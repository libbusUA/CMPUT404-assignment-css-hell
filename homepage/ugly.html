        <p class="who-description">Hello! I am a soon to be graduate from the University of Alberta. 
          I will be graduating at the end of April in 2023 and am currently planning to become a 
          IT professional. In my spare time I am a competative curler with lots of success at the 
          Junior level and am currently working hard to create success at the Mens Curling level. 
          This hard work that I have gained from sports has allowed me a "110%" effort mindset with
          a strong team working attitude.

Project Gutenberg Documents:
============================
For the project gutenberg documents I created a abckground color for the entire page changing the background colors to a more yellowish paper like tone to portray the age of the books. I then applied a fantasy font that showed off the idea that these were originally handwritten. Next I aligned all the text in the center and removed all indentations also setting width to 100% to ensure all text was in a similar box size. for the paragraphs I also aligned them to senter and changed the color of the text to a more black-grey tone to create similarity to handwritten ink and pen adding in padding to the sides to ensure the content was all within the sides of a screen. and setup the font size to medium to make the size more easily readable. I updated the i tag to ensure we saw boplding when necessary as well. 

For the header tags I went and made sure they were all in bold top show off the aspect of them being titles for something and aligned them all to the center. I also created a small margin from the top to make sure that the headers were all very seperate from previous text. I also added in a larger font size to again show off the title aspect of the headers. Similar aspects were added to h1 and h2 headers. on h3 headers all the was done was bolding them to make sure that these were seen as smaller texts but still a header type format.  

The table tag was also adjusted to be updated so that the table of contents of each book was centered asnd aligned according to the rest of the text.

The .fig class is used to set the box width of the object so that it can be overridden and aligned better with the rest of the text.

Lastly the images were updated to havea relative position with an auto height and border which is set to a 0.2em solid black line around so that the image stands out more and if the image is not available then the text stands out and is presented as if it were an image.
